### Interactive Automotive industry analysing app
This app helps people involved in the Automotive industry to analyse trends in various sections related to cars using previously available data

## About the App
Being a automobile manufacturer is no longer a thing of difficulty with your very own 'interactive' web ally, Automob-Ally. Let's begin by looking at the state of the automobile industry to evaluate its condition using this data.
This web application is my submission for the month long challenge to build a video-calling app in **Engage'21, a mentorship program conducted by Microsoft.**

## How to run this project locally
1. Clone the given repository into your device.

2. Run the command `pip install requirements.txt` in your terminal in the root directory of the project to install the various dependencies.

3. Now, use the command `streamlit run webapp.py` in the same directory.

4. The app now opens up in your default web browser.

## App Features
- Shows the data of the market so that manufacturers and allows them to iscover and look over the dataset used to analyse.
- Each column can be sorted by just clicking on the column name
- A description table with minimum, maximum, 50%, 25%, etc of the data.
- Price and power calculators to help user out with the scaling used in the tables.
- Analysis based on body type and fuel type of a vehicle, which are among the decisive factors that divide customer opinions thus giving us customer segments for the first division.
- Preliminary EDA with correlation matrix and price vs other factor Analysis for inspection of factors at a glance
- Power, price, mileage interactive graph for the automotive industry men to easily hover over and determine where their upcoming car model lies
- Animated scatterplot to easily map out the relation between any two columns from the data.
- A filter to determine competitors based on fuel type and body type.
- Selecting a certain range of price to see how many other competitors a model, if released now, will have in the industry.
- Interactive UI for all kinds of analysis
- Visually appealing than long long lines of code.
- Responsive and interactive with its plotly graphs.

## Thought behind the UI
As a mechanical engineering student with a keen interest for data analysis, I wanted the automtive insudtry to have an interactive UI based app to be able to compare between factors that determine the selling capability of a vehicle.I wanted it to be simple and eye catching so that even people who have not much experience with web applications could use it. This is why the design has been kept minimalistic throughout and features shades of blue since the colour is very easy on the eyes.

## Future Scope of the App
The dataset can easily be replaced every year and the same app can be used for years to come. Interactive and custom bar charts, line charts, etc can be added for advanced analysis. An appropriate ML model by using data not just collected over a few years, rather data that existed over decades and how it evolved along with some customer data to determine customer buying trends and take the app a step further.
